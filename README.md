Multilabel classification is one of the category in the world of classification. It basically means that in a scenario where there are n inputs and more than one outputs(labels), for every single set of input the classification will have more than one labels generated. This project compares various classification algorithms available in skmultilearn library and finds the ones most efficient for the dataset in use. The task is to predict the types on defects in stainless steel plates given a number of different measures and specifications on the plates. The file "detailed report" describes the project along with the code attached.
